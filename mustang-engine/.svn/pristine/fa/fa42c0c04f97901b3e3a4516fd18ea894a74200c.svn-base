Some things to note:
-Rendering is in order (No painters algorithm)
    -this was chosen to save problems and also because
     the game we're making is horizontal so order of drawing really
     isn't very relevant
    -Yes, this means we always add the background first because
     we always want it to be draw first

-The scene manager is in no way functional atm and is not culling at all
 at the moment; yes this means if you add 1000 objects offscreen, I assume
 it will begin to lag

Some Todos:
-throw physix into the engine (because right now, we're just cheating the floor)
-Legitimize things, add in a sprite handler
    -this is simply extending the render method implementation
-add in an asset manager; this way we can easily track a loading bar if need be (y)
-add in support for GUI (this is probably what you're looking for :D)

-triple check all bind-related functions; strict pointer control is crucial

-implement game states (for easy shifting between game controls, etc)
